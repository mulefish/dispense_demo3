Dispensego contacted out to some web house in Bangladore - 
Their product is pretty enough, and works on mobile. 
But they are terrible about folding in our backend api. 
So the site might as well be a series of pretty PDFs for all the interactivey(sic) that it has.
I've really been stressing about the upcoming demo. 
I've decided to just f*cking make the site. 
I have the entire API laying at my feet - will be a long weekend. 
But since I've made this choice my heart feels -so- much lighter.
